## Tips for Submission: Hackathon Proof of Concept (POC)
For the hackathon, the level of your Proof of Concept (POC) will depend on your teamâ€™s skills and resources. To help guide you, here are three distinct levels of POC you can aim for, along with tips for creating an effective presentation:
1. Mockup or Visual Prototype
- Description: Create a visual representation of your concept using tools like Adobe XD, Figma, or Flutter.
- Example: An interactive UI design that showcases how the solution would work, without requiring backend development.
- Goal: Clearly and attractively demonstrate your idea, focusing on the user experience.
2. Functional Proof of Concept (Minimum MVP)
- Description: Develop a minimal functional version of your concept with basic features implemented.
- Example: An app that allows users to plan travel routes using a maps API, but without complex integrations.
- Goal: Show that the idea is technically feasible and can be scaled with further development.
3. Advanced Prototype with Integrations
- Description: Build a more comprehensive prototype that includes integrations with APIs, databases, or advanced technologies like AI or IoT.
- Example: An app that not only plans routes but also suggests personalized stops based on user interests, using machine learning.
- Goal: Demonstrate a robust and scalable solution, ready for real-world implementation.

**The Importance of Presentation**

No matter the level of POC your team chooses, creating an effective presentation is a critical part of the process. Your presentation is your opportunity to:
- **Explain the Problem:** Provide context for your solution and its relevance to Harley-Davidson.
- **Showcase the Value:** Demonstrate how your solution positively impacts KPIs or enhances the user experience.
- **Convince the Judges:** Clearly and persuasively communicate the feasibility and potential of your idea.

A strong presentation can make all the difference, even if your POC is a mockup or a basic prototype. Focus on clarity, creativity, and storytelling to make your solution stand out.
